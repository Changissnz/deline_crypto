Engine that performs encoding and decoding of character sequences with the aid of
a given `n`-dimensional dataset (with non-missing values)
of decimal values.

Depending on usage, the encoding can be considered as
cryptographic.

User instructions and a paper are to be published by 
me w/in these next few months that details the 
capabilities and deficits of this system.
